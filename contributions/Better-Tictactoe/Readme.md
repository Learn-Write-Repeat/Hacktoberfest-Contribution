## Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript,HTML,CSS.

How to implement a 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript? It is quite easy to develop with some simple validations and error checks. Player-1 starts playing the game and both the players make their moves in consecutive turns. The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game. This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.

Game Flow: needs to track any clicks that happen on our cells needs to check if a valid move has been made needs to make sure nothing happens if an already played cell has been clicked we should update our game state we should validate the game state check if a player has won check if the game ended in a draw either stop the game or change the active player, depending on the above checks reflect the updates made on the UI rinse and repeat

Game Rules:
After each move,the turns will get swapped and a player is declared as a winner if he manages to fill three elements of a column or a row or of the diagonal with a similar element,the game continues until all the elements are filled and if there is not any winner then we end the game in a draw and then we can restart tha game.
