Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript,HTML,CSS.

How to implement a 2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript? 
It is quite easy to develop with some simple validations and error checks. Player-1 starts playing the game and both the players make their moves in consecutive turns.
The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game. This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.

Game Flow: 
needs to track any clicks that happen on our cells 
needs to check if a valid move has been made 
needs to make sure nothing happens if an already played cell has been clicked we should update our game state we should validate the game state 
check if a player has won 
check if the game ended in a draw either stop the game or change the active player, depending on the above checks reflect the updates made on the UI 
rinse and repeat
