## Prerequisite

### Git & Github
Here, we have mentioned the instructions to set up git. If you don't already know what Git is, check out this blog series on [iRead](https://iread.ga/series/1/git-and-github).

- Login / Sign-up to [Github](https://github.com/login).
- Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Configure git
    - Launch terminal or command promt.
    - Run the commands.
        - `git config --global user.name "Your name"`
        - `git config --global user.email "Your email address"` 
 - Optionally, you can [setup ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to authenticate easily. 

### What to Contribute

You are free to select any topic such as Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Web Development, etc. Your contribution can be **your mini-project**, **algorithms**, **solution to coding problem**, etc. Just make sure to follow the below guidelines strictly.

## How to contribute?

Refer to [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to setup the repository.

Once you are ready with the setup, follow the below guidelines:

1. Create a folder inside contributions folder with the Topic Name in snake case, i.e., if your topic is URL Shortener using Flask, the folder name should be **url_shortener_using_flask**.

2. Create a markdown file called README.md inside the folder and describe your topic. The description can be **Problem statement of your code**, **Algorithm description**, or something that is relevant to your code.

3. Also, add screenshots, or codes, or Jupyter notebooks inside the same folder.

4. After adding these files, you need to [add yourself as contributor](#add-yourself-as-contributor).


### Add Yourself as Contributor

1. Go to `resources/contributors.json` file, where you will find other contributor details as:
```json
{
    "contributors":[
        {
            "name": "Ashutosh Krishna",
            "github_username": "ashutoshkrris",
            "image_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47353498?v=4",
            "title": "Python API Tutorial",
            "short_description": "In this Python API tutorial, we’ll learn how to retrieve data using requests library. There are millions of APIs online which provide access to data.",
            "folder_url": "https://contribute.devincept.com/Hacktoberfest-Contributions/contributions/python-api-tutorial/"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Within the contributors array, add your details in the form of map/dictionary as : 
```json
{
    "contributors":[
        {
            "name": "Ashutosh Krishna",
            "github_username": "ashutoshkrris",
            "image_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47353498?v=4",
            "title": "Python API Tutorial",
            "short_description": "In this Python API tutorial, we’ll learn how to retrieve data using requests library. There are millions of APIs online which provide access to data.",
            "folder_url": "https://contribute.devincept.com/Hacktoberfest-Contributions/contributions/python-api-tutorial/"
        },
        {
            "name": "Your Name Here",
            "github_username": "Your Github Username Here",
            "image_url": "Your Image URL",
            "title": "Title of your Contribution",
            "short_description": "Short description of your contribution",
            "folder_url": "https://contribute.devincept.com/Hacktoberfest-Contributions/contributions/<your-folder-name>/"
        }
    ]
}
```

> **Note : For the folder_url, just replace `<your-folder-name>` with the name of your folder.**
